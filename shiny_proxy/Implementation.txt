Key Implementation Details
1. Pre-initialization Flow
Containers start before user authentication
ShinyProxy passes auth data via HTTP headers instead of environment variables
Apps must handle both header-based and env-based authentication
2. Container Pool Management
container-instances-min: Maintains minimum number of ready containers
container-instances-max: Limits maximum containers to control costs
container-idle-timeout: Releases idle containers back to pool
container-sharing-enabled: Allows multiple users to share containers
3. Security Considerations
Headers are only trusted from ShinyProxy (not from external sources)
Redis namespacing prevents data leakage between teams
Access control via access-users and access-groups
Container isolation at network level
4. Resource Optimization
Pre-initialized containers reduce startup time from minutes to seconds
Container sharing reduces resource usage for read-only apps
Scheduled pre-initialization (business hours only) saves costs
Idle timeout returns containers to pool
5. Monitoring and Operations
CloudWatch metrics for container utilization
Health checks ensure container readiness
Recovery mechanisms for failed containers
Logging integration for debugging
6. Deployment Considerations
Each team needs:
ECS cluster with appropriate capacity
S3 bucket with apps.yml
Redis instance (can be shared with namespacing)
Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
IAM roles with proper permissions
7. ALB Routing
Use header-based routing rules
Path-based routing as fallback
Health checks on /actuator/health
This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for running ShinyProxy with pre-initialized containers on AWS ECS, supporting multi-tenancy and optimized resource usage.
