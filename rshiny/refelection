1. Goal: Follow Standard Practices
Reflection:

What went well:
Adhered to standard ITSM practices using ServiceNow for incident, problem, and change management. Ensured SLA compliance for incident resolution and change implementation. Followed structured CR procedures for SageMaker-related deployments.

Tools & Processes:
Leveraged Jira for agile sprint planning and internal tracking. Used Terraform Cloud for IaC standardization and version-controlled deployments. Maintained code quality and traceability via GitLab CI/CD.

What can be improved:
Improve CR turnaround time and ensure regular retrospective documentation of incidents to reduce recurrence.

Next steps:
Implement dashboards to track SLA compliance trends. Introduce automated changelog generation for deployments.

2. Goal: Implemented Automation
Reflection:

What went well:
Designed and implemented GitLab CI/CD pipelines for multiple AWS environments. Automated:

SageMaker domain & team provisioning.

Temporary credential generation via AWS API.

SSH key management for Terraform Cloud.

Terraform workspace configuration (one per team) using reusable main.tf and team-specific .tfvars.

Additional Impact:
Automated ECS cluster creation and image build pipelines for ShinyProxy applications. Streamlined runtime image packaging using Python scripts.

What can be improved:
Add rollback strategies for failed CI/CD pipeline stages. Improve parallel deployment capabilities.

Next steps:
Introduce approval gates and Slack/email notifications for pipeline events. Move towards GitOps-style state reconciliation using Terraform drift detection.

3. Goal: Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
Reflection:

What went well:
Completed 75% of CKA training ahead of schedule. Booked exam and practiced using real-world cluster scenarios in internal UAT environments.

What can be improved:
Due to project deliverables, had to push exam date to October. Need better work-study balance during delivery peak phases.

Next steps:
Schedule weekly learning slots and leverage idle CI/CD resources for hands-on labs. Aim to complete certification by end of October.

4. Goal: Primary Skill Assessment
Reflection:

What went well:
Completed the primary skill proficiency assessment earlier with P2 level. Also received P3 proficiency in AWS Skill Assessment recently.

Client recognition:
Received appreciation from client for AWS workload optimization and automation efforts in SageMaker and CI/CD operations.

What could be better:
The earlier skill test was cut midway due to technical issues â€” plan to retake and target P3 proficiency.

Next steps:
Retake skill assessment by month-end and continue contributing to AWS-specific automation use cases.
