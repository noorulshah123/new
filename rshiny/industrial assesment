2. Complete Ethics Compliance and Mandatory Trainings
Reflection for Priority:
What went WELL:

Proactively tracked and initiated all mandatory training requirements including Ethics Compliance, Industry standards, DLF (Data Loss Prevention), and TQ (Technology Quotient)
Achieved "Distinctive Impact" rating demonstrating exceptional commitment to organizational compliance
Completed critical compliance modules ahead of deadlines, setting example for team members
Applied ethics and compliance principles in daily work, especially in handling sensitive client data in AWS environments
Integrated security and compliance best practices learned from trainings into CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure designs

What could do BETTER:

Complete remaining modules to achieve 100% compliance status
Create team calendar for tracking collective training deadlines
Document key learnings from trainings for team reference

What will do NEXT:

Complete all pending mandatory trainings within next 2 weeks
Implement compliance checkpoints in our terraform deployments based on DLF training insights
Share TQ learnings with team to enhance overall technology quotient
Create compliance checklist for new team members based on training experiences
Apply ethics training principles in vendor management and client interactions
