1. Delivery - Follow Standard Practices
What went WELL:

Successfully maintained Service Now incident resolution within SLA targets, ensuring timely response and resolution for platform issues
Implemented standardized Change Request procedures for all AWS SageMaker domain deployments, reducing failed changes
Established consistent Jira workflows for development tracking, improving visibility across Platform and Development teams
Adhered to AWS Well-Architected Framework principles for SageMaker services architecture
Maintained proper documentation and knowledge articles in Service Now for common issues

What could do BETTER:

Enhance automation of routine Service Now tickets to reduce manual intervention
Implement proactive monitoring to prevent incidents before they occur
Strengthen change advisory board (CAB) documentation with more detailed impact analysis

What will do NEXT:

Develop runbooks for top 5 recurring incident types
Implement automated ticket routing based on service components
Create service catalog items for common SageMaker domain requests

2. Implemented Automation
What went WELL:

Successfully designed and deployed GitLab CI/CD pipelines across dev/staging/prod environments, reducing deployment time by 70%
Automated Terraform Cloud integration with dynamic workspace provisioning for multiple teams, managing 15+ SageMaker domains
Implemented secure credential management using temporary AWS STS tokens and SSH key rotation
Built comprehensive Docker image pipelines for Shiny proxy, app-runtime, and custom SageMaker kernel images (JupyterLab, Code Editor, R-kernel)
Created modular Terraform architecture with single main.tf and team-specific tfvars, improving code maintainability
Automated ECS cluster provisioning for Shiny applications with auto-scaling capabilities

What could do BETTER:

Implement automated rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
Add more comprehensive testing stages in CI/CD pipeline
Enhance monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures

What will do NEXT:

Implement GitOps approach for infrastructure changes
Add automated security scanning in image build pipelines
Create self-service portal for team workspace provisioning

3. CKA Certification
What went WELL:

Completed 75% of Kubernetes Administrator curriculum, gaining hands-on experience with cluster management
Proactively purchased certification exam showing commitment to professional development
Applied Kubernetes concepts to understand container orchestration patterns used in ECS/SageMaker

What could do BETTER:

Better time management to balance certification preparation with project deliverables
Could have leveraged team knowledge-sharing sessions for collaborative learning

What will do NEXT:

Complete remaining 25% of curriculum by September
Schedule dedicated study time weekly
Take certification exam by October 31st as planned
Share learnings with team through knowledge transfer sessions

4. Self Development - Industry Skill Assessment
What went WELL:

Achieved P2 proficiency in primary skill assessment demonstrating solid technical foundation
Earned P3 proficiency in AWS skill assessment, validating deep expertise in cloud services
Received client appreciation for exceptional delivery and technical problem-solving
Successfully managed complex AWS workloads including SageMaker, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, Lambda, and S3 integrations
Gained expertise in Infrastructure as Code using Terraform Cloud

What could do BETTER:

Complete the full assessment without technical interruptions
Prepare more thoroughly for edge case scenarios in assessments

What will do NEXT:

Retake primary skill assessment targeting P3/P4 proficiency by month-end
Document best practices from AWS workload management experience
Pursue AWS specialty certifications to complement existing expertise
Mentor junior team members on AWS services and IaC practices

Additional Points to Highlight:

Cross-functional collaboration: Working across Platform and Development teams
Security focus: Implementation of secure credential management, secrets rotation
Innovation: Custom kernel images for specialized data science workflows
Scale: Managing infrastructure for multiple teams through centralized platform
Cost optimization: Efficient resource utilization through workspace segregation
