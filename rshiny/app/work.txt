You're absolutely right. Let me carefully review your working Dockerfile and incorporate all the missing components including Snowflake ODBC/JDBC installations, pip.conf, and other configurations while maintaining the permission fixes.Updated Dockerfile for Ubuntu 24.04 with Shiny ServerCode ∙ Version 2 # Use Ubuntu 24.04 as base image
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Set environment variables

ENV SF_JDBC_VERSION 3.13.34
ENV SNOWFLAKE_FILE snowflake_linux_x86Strategized Dockerfile updates for comprehensive R and server setup.1sI need to continue updating the Dockerfile with all the missing components. Let me add the rest of the R installation, Shiny Server installation, and most importantly, all the permission fixes and directory creation that were missing.Updated Dockerfile for Ubuntu 24.04 with Shiny ServerCode ∙ Version 3 # Install Shiny Server
RUN wget --no-verbose https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-18.04/x86_64/shiny-server-${SHINY_SERVER_VERSION}-amd64.deb \

    gdebi -n ss-latest.deb && \
    rm ss-latest.deb

# Create the shiny user anDiagnosed and reconstructed Dockerfile with comprehensive fixes.3sI notice there are still some issues with the Dockerfile. Let me fix:

The R installation section needs to be properly added
There are syntax errors in the R package installation commands
The SNOWFLAKE_FILE variable wasn't defined before use
There are duplicate package installations
Need to fix the proper order of operations

Let me create a completely new, clean version of the Dockerfile that incorporates everything properly.Let me create a complete, corrected Dockerfile that includes all the components from your working version plus the necessary permission fixes:Updated Dockerfile for Ubuntu 24.04 with Shiny ServerCode ∙ Version 4 # Use Ubuntu 24.04 as base image

ARPondered creating shiny-server configuration file for Dockerfile.1sNow let me also create the shiny-server.conf file that should be used with this Dockerfile.Now let me update the shiny-server.conf file to match the rocker/shiny configuration:Shiny Server ConfigurationCode ∙ Version 2 # Instruct Shiny Server to run applications as the user "shiny"
run_as shiny;

# Preserve environment variables when running as a different user
preserve_logs true;

# Define a server that listens on port 3838

  listen 3838;

  # Define a loPondered creating missing pip.conf configuration file.1sI should also create a sample pip.conf file since it's referenced in the Dockerfile but wasn't provided.Let me also create a sample pip.conf file that you'll need:pip.conf configuration fileCode [global]
trusted-host = pypi.org
               pypi.python.org
               files.pythonhosted.org
index-url = https://pypi.org/simple/
extra-index-url = https://pypi.python.org/simple/

[install]
trusted-host = pypi.org
               pypi.pythonSketched potential directory structure for user's request.1sLet me also create an example directory structure that the user should follow:Summary of Changes and Key Points:
1. Complete Package Installation

Added all missing dependencies including Snowflake ODBC/JDBC drivers
Included pip.conf configuration
Python 3.11 installation from source
Complete R package list with version downgrades

2. Fixed Permission Issues

Created a wrapper script (/usr/bin/shiny-server-wrapper.sh) that ensures all directories have proper permissions at runtime
The wrapper runs as root initially but ensures shiny user owns all necessary directories
Added bookmarks directory creation: /var/lib/shiny-server/bookmarks

3. Directory Structure Required
Your build directory should have this structure:
.
├── Dockerfile
├── shiny-server.conf
├── pip.conf
├── cloudguard-root.crt
├── app-runtime/
│   └── artifacts/
│       └── odbc.ini
└── app-runtime-rshiny/
    ├── artifacts/
    │   └── odbc.ini
    └── shiny-server.sh
4. Key Differences from Original

Wrapper Script: The main difference is the addition of a wrapper script that runs at container startup to ensure permissions are correct
Runtime Permission Fix: Instead of only setting permissions at build time, we ensure they're correct at runtime
User Management: The container starts as root but the wrapper ensures shiny-server runs as the shiny user
Bookmarks Directory: Specifically creates the bookmarks directory that was causing your error

5. Build and Run Commands
bash# Build the image
docker build -t shiny-ubuntu:24.04 .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3838:3838 \
  -e APPLICATION_LOGS_TO_STDOUT=true \
  -e SHINY_LOG_STDERR=1 \
  -v /path/to/your/apps:/srv/shiny-server \
  -v /path/to/logs:/var/log/shiny-server \
  shiny-ubuntu:24.04

# For debugging
docker run -it -p 3838:3838 shiny-ubuntu:24.04 /bin/bash
6. ECS Considerations
For ECS, make sure your task definition includes:

Proper IAM role with S3 access for apps.yml
Environment variables for AWS credentials if needed
Health check pointing to /
Sufficient memory allocation (at least 2GB recommended)

The main issue in your original setup was that the shiny user didn't have write permissions to create the bookmarks directory at runtime. The rocker/shiny image handles this by using a combination of proper directory creation and a startup script that ensures permissions are correct. This updated Dockerfile follows the same pattern while using Ubuntu 24.04 as the base.
