1. Follow Standard Practices
What went WELL:

Successfully integrated Service Now ticketing system with our development workflow, ensuring proper incident tracking and SLA adherence
Established Jira board practices for internal development tracking, improving visibility into sprint progress and deliverables
Implemented standardized change request procedures following Service Now protocols for all infrastructure modifications
Maintained consistent GitLab CI/CD practices across multiple environments and teams
Adhered to AWS best practices for SageMaker domain management and associated services (S3, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store)

What could be BETTER:

Could improve incident SLA response times by implementing automated alerts and escalation procedures
Change request documentation could be more standardized with templates and checklists
Need better integration between Service Now and Jira for seamless workflow transitions

What will do NEXT:

Develop automated SLA monitoring dashboards for better incident management
Create standardized templates for change requests and deployment procedures
Implement automated compliance checks in CI/CD pipelines to ensure standard practices are followed

2. Implemented Automation
What went WELL:

Successfully implemented GitLab CI/CD pipelines that automate Terraform deployments across multiple environments
Created automated API operations for temporary credential generation and Terraform Cloud registration
Developed automated SSH key generation for secure module downloads by Terraform Cloud
Built automated pipeline for ECS cluster creation supporting Shiny Proxy applications
Implemented image build automation for Shiny Proxy and app-runtime environments
Established single main.tf architecture with team-specific tfvars for scalable SageMaker domain management

What could be BETTER:

Could implement automated apply processes with proper approval workflows instead of manual apply steps
Error handling and rollback mechanisms in pipelines could be enhanced
Monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures needs improvement

What will do NEXT:

Implement automated approval workflows for Terraform apply operations
Add comprehensive pipeline monitoring and alerting capabilities
Expand automation to cover additional AWS services and deployment scenarios

3. CKA Certification
What went WELL:

Successfully completed 75% of the learning curriculum ahead of schedule
Enrolled for certification exam early, showing proactive planning
Gained access to comprehensive learning materials and hands-on labs

What could be BETTER:

Better time management between work commitments and certification preparation
Could have planned for potential work conflicts when setting initial exam date
Need more consistent daily study schedule

What will do NEXT:

Complete remaining 25% of curriculum by end of September
Schedule and complete CKA certification exam by October end
Apply Kubernetes knowledge to current infrastructure projects

4. Industry Skill Assessment
What went WELL:

Successfully completed primary skill assessment achieving P2 proficiency initially
Achieved P3 proficiency in AWS skill assessment, demonstrating strong cloud expertise
Received client appreciation for recent AWS workload management activities
Demonstrated commitment to continuous learning and skill development

What could be BETTER:

Technical issues during assessment completion need to be anticipated and mitigated
Could have prepared better backup plans for assessment completion
Need more consistent skill development practice

What will do NEXT:

Retake and complete the assessment targeting higher proficiency level by month end
Leverage recent client appreciation and AWS workload management experience
Continue building on P3 AWS proficiency with advanced certifications and practical applications
